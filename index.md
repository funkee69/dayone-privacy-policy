# DayOne Privacy Policy

**Last updated: September 17, 2025**

## Introduction

This privacy policy describes how DayOne ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information.

## Information We Collect

We collect and store the following information:

- Your game watchlist, backlog, and game preferences (stored locally and optionally in Google Drive)
- App settings including language, theme, and notification preferences (stored locally)
- Notification preferences and scheduled notifications (stored locally)

## Purchase Information

When you make in-app purchases, we collect and process the following purchase-related information:

- Purchase receipts and transaction IDs (processed by Apple App Store or Google Play Store)
- Purchase status and entitlement information (stored locally and encrypted)
- Purchase validation data (used to verify legitimate purchases)

## Permissions We Request

Our app requests the following permissions to provide its functionality:

- **Notifications**: used to send you reminders about upcoming game releases based on your preferences
- **Storage**: used to save your watchlist, settings, and preferences locally on your device
- **Google Drive (optional)**: used for cloud backup and sync of your game data across devices when you choose to enable this feature

## How We Use Your Information

Your data is primarily stored locally on your device and encrypted using industry-standard encryption. When you enable cloud backup, your encrypted data is stored in your private Google Drive folder. We use this information solely to provide app functionality including maintaining your watchlist, sending notifications, syncing across devices, and preserving your preferences.

## How We Use Purchase Information

Purchase information is used solely to provide and maintain your Pro features, validate your entitlements, and ensure proper functionality of premium features. This data is encrypted and stored locally on your device, with purchase validation handled through secure communication with app store servers.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit your personal information to third parties. Your data remains on your device and, if you choose, in your private Google Drive folder. The app connects to IGDB.com only to fetch publicly available game information and does not send any of your personal data. When using Google Drive backup, your data is encrypted before being stored in your private Google Drive folder.

## Purchase Data Sharing

We do not share your purchase information with third parties. Purchase validation occurs directly between the app and Apple/Google servers using secure, encrypted connections. No purchase data is transmitted to our servers or any other third-party services.

## Data Security

Your data is encrypted using Expo crypto libraries before being stored locally or in Google Drive. All cloud backups are encrypted with a key derived from your Google account, ensuring only you can access your data. You have full control over your information and can delete local data by uninstalling the app, or cloud data through the app settings.

## Purchase Data Security

Purchase information and entitlement status are encrypted using industry-standard encryption before being stored locally. Purchase receipts are validated through secure connections with app store servers. You can reset your purchase status by reinstalling the app, and purchases can be restored through the app store's built-in restoration mechanism.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data. You can delete individual games, or remove all data by uninstalling the app. No account registration is required, and no personal information is collected beyond what you choose to store locally.

## Payment Processing

All payment processing is handled securely by Apple App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment method details such as credit card numbers, billing addresses, or other financial information. Payment transactions are processed according to Apple's and Google's respective privacy policies and terms of service.

## Refunds and Cancellations

DayOne Pro is a one-time lifetime purchase with no recurring subscriptions. Refund requests must be made directly through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store according to their respective refund policies. We do not process refunds directly. If you receive a refund, your Pro features will be automatically disabled.

## Third-Party Services

We use IGDB.com to fetch game information and Google Drive (when you enable cloud backup) to store your encrypted data. We also use Apple App Store and Google Play Store for payment processing. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for information about their data practices:

- **IGDB.com**: We do not send any of your personal information to IGDB
- **Google Drive**: Only receives your encrypted backup data when you explicitly enable this feature
- **Apple App Store & Google Play Store**: Handle all payment processing securely without sharing payment details with us

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our data practices, please contact us through the app store where you downloaded this application.
