## Introduction

This privacy policy describes how DayOne ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information.

## Information We Collect

We collect and store the following information locally on your device:

• Your game watchlist and preferences
• App settings including language and theme preferences  
• Notification preferences and scheduled notifications

## Permissions We Request

Our app requests the following permissions to provide its functionality:

• **Camera**: used only for scanning QR codes to import/export watchlists. We do not store or transmit any camera data.
• **Notifications**: used to send you reminders about upcoming game releases based on your preferences.
• **Storage**: used to save your watchlist, settings, and preferences locally on your device.

## How We Use Your Information

All your data is stored locally on your device. We use this information solely to provide app functionality including maintaining your watchlist, sending notifications, and preserving your preferences. We do not transmit your personal data to external servers.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit your personal information to third parties. Your data remains on your device. The app connects to IGDB.com only to fetch publicly available game information and does not send any of your personal data.

## Data Security

Your data is stored securely on your device using standard mobile security practices. Since all data is local, you have full control over your information. You can delete all app data by uninstalling the application.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data. You can export your watchlist via QR code, delete individual games, or remove all data by uninstalling the app. No account registration is required, and no personal information is collected beyond what you choose to store locally.

## Third-Party Services

We use IGDB.com to fetch game information. Please refer to their privacy policy for information about their data practices. We do not send any of your personal information to IGDB or any other third-party service.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
