# DayOne — never miss a game release

DayOne helps you track the releases that matter, organize your watchlist and backlog, and receive alerts before launch as well as delay notifications. The app is available in English and French, supports light and dark themes, and offers, in Pro (one-time purchase), Google Drive cloud sync so you can keep your lists across devices.

The free version lets you manage up to 15 games in your watchlist and 15 in your backlog, with release and delay alerts included for those titles. The Pro upgrade removes these limits and enables cloud backup.
